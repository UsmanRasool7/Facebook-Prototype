# Social Networking System Prototype - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Project

## Overview
This project is a prototype that demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in the context of a social networking system.

### Purpose and Limitations
This project serves as an educational or exploratory exercise to showcase the implementation of OOP principles within a social networking environment. It is not intended as a fully functional, deployable application.

### Project Structure
The project comprises several key components designed using OOP concepts:

- **User**: Represents a user profile, including attributes like name, connections, and associated functionalities.
- **Post**: Encapsulates data and behaviors related to user posts, such as content, timestamps, and engagement metrics.
- **Page**: Represents a public page or community within the social network.
- **Comment**: Manages the creation and administration of comments on posts.
- **SocialNetworkUtility**: Offers a collection of static utility functions tailored for handling C-style strings.

### Sample Data Files
The project includes the following sample data files to simulate various aspects of the social networking system:

- **SocialNetworkUsers.txt**: Contains user profile information.
- **SocialNetworkPosts.txt**: Stores post data, including content, timestamps, and user interactions.
- **SocialNetworkPages.txt**: Holds information about public pages or communities within the network.
- **SocialNetworkComments.txt**: Stores data pertaining to comments made on posts.
